* export correctly

* styling
 - make it look less bad
 - class-based styling? how does that work in libraries?
 - customizable styling
* should cost (or other attributes) always be present
* more explicit action to collapse nodes (so we can copy from node detail text)
* figure out huge index conds / other huge detail values (show subset, expandable)
* show index names in summary view
* draw lines to connect nodes
* add non-storyshot tests (e.g. simulating interaction)
* see if moving to a react library template buys us anything
